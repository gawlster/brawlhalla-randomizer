    "lore": "The Mad King of Batavia was a demanding father, and his lunacy honed his son into the greatest thief ever known. “Steal me the Royal Sceptre of hamburg, the nose of the Sphinx, and the beard of the emperor of China!” his father would rave, and Caspian would deliver them all. | But his father’s rule descended from capricious to diabolical, and when the Order of the Exalted Lion stepped in, the young prince quietly vanished. | On his own, The Great Caspian’s showmanship and thirst for danger only grew. His theatrical heists left his targets applauding more often than calling the police. He replaced the Mona Lisa with a portrait of himself with an enigmatic smile. He stole the Crown Jewels of Britain with one hand actually tied behind his back. Citizens of Kiev woke up one morning to find he had somehow stolen their entire city and was now, in every legal way, their Mayor. | Emboldened by cheers of the people, Caspian stepped up his game. He won the Battle of Trafalgar disguised as Admiral Nelson. He won the Kentucky Derby disguised as a horse. He decided to take some time for himself, and August 32nd was never seen again. | In Valhalla he has not slowed his larcenous ways. He disguised himself as Vraxx for an entire tournament – a tournament Vraxx was in. He stole Thatch’s beard and replaced it with bees. He stole Cross’s coin and quickly gave it back. None doubt that the Grand Tournament is his stage now, and he’s here to give them a show.",
