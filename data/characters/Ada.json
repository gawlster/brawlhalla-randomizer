Part of an experimental group, Ada’s public education neuro-sims were replaced with training in real-time signal decryption and urban warfare.\nGraduates of the experiment joined Meyers Baby Food Corp’s black ops division, but Ada hacked the corporation’s maincloud and learned her division was protecting the Upload Enslavement Initiative. Soon, records of Meyers’ secret operations were playing on every news feed, and Ada had disappeared.\nIn the undersea free state of Miami Dome, Ada founded the Right Wrong Cavaliers, an elite team of combat hackers and post-punk revival band, and she led their masterful guerilla campaign against Meyers and their shadowy GovernCorp backers.\nShe’s pretty sure Valhalla is all some sort of computer sim, but until she can find a way out, she’s playing to win.",
